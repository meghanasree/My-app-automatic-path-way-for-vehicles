 # SWOT ANALYSIS
 
 # Strength

 - Increase road safety

 - Improves traffic flow

# Weakness

 - Take More time

 - It require manual operation

# Opportunities
 - Business strategy: You will better understand how a smart street lighting solution enables you to successfully meet your business outcomes

 - Technology decisions: You will learn how a smart street lighting solution works to deliver IT and business value

# Threats

- The absence of those traffic lights and even others that are not functioning properly pose danger to pedestrians, drivers and motorbike riders

# 4W's and 1H

# Who

- B.Meghana try to implement a problem statement

# What

 - Implementation of Automatic path way for emergency vehicles
 
# Where

 - Fire extinguishing vehicles

 - Police vans in emergency

 # How
 
 - This application is implemented using C programing language
 
 # High level requirements
 
 - By Placing sound sensor on either side of the round .By using sound sensor giving - Green signal to the emgerncy vehicles path.
 
 # Low level requirements
 
 - To study on equipments and tools used and their specifications.

 - To study on the features of microprocessor to more focus in respect of working- This application is implemented using C programing language.

 - Writing the program to control the traffic system.

 - Connecting IR sensors and GPIO pins.

 - Power on the system and testing the functionality of it placing some obstacles in front of the IR sensors observing the LED glow.
