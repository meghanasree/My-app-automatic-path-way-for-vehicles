# project name is Automatic path way for emergency vehicles.

 - The main motto of this project is that drivers will not spend unneccesary time waiting for the signals to change.Many traffic lights operate on timing mechanism.In this 
system we use IR sensors and microcontrollers.Microcontrollers used to measure the traffic density.IR sensors is used to sense the presence or absence of vehicles.
IR sensors are interfaced with the microcontrollers.IR sensors are connected to the PORT B  of the microcontroller.Traffic lights are connected to the PORT C and PORT D of the
microcontrollers.IR sensors are mounted on the either side of the road.When any vehicle pass on the road the sensors produce output as logic 1.When microcontroller recieves   logic 1 it gives green signal to that particular path and give red signal to all the remaining paths.By Using this project we can reduce congestion control.And improve green house effect.

 - By placing sound sensor on the sides of the road.If it recognizes any emergency vehicles like ambulance,fire engines etc.It gives green signal to that particular path
   and give red signal to the all remaining paths.This is how this project is usefull.
